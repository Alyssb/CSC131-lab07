I'm not entirely sure what format you wanted our submission for the day in so I hope that this counts? I also sent a message on slack but
I will do it here as well. I learned a couple new commands for using a terminal (like cat) and I'm very interested in being able to use 
these commands on my own in the future so I hope that we go over them a bit more. I'm also really excited to learn a new language, 
especially since most of the people I know who are also in computer science know several of them. Thank you!
